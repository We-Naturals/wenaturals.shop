No worries! I'll clarify exactly what needs to be done.

The feature we just built (creating an admin user directly) is a "Super Admin" capability. It requires a special key from Supabase that allows us to bypass the usual security rules—so we can create a user without logging out of your current account.

Here is the step-by-step guide to fix it:

1. Find Your Secret Key
Go to your Supabase Dashboard (supabase.com).
Open your project (We Naturals).
Click on Settings (Gear icon at the bottom left) -> API.
Look for the section Project API keys.
You will see two keys: anon (public) and service_role (secret).
Copy the service_role key. (It usually starts with ey... and says "secret").
2. Add it to Your Project
Open the file named 
.env.local
 in your project folder (I can see you already have this file).
Add a new line at the bottom and paste the key you copied:
env
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9... (paste your actual key here)
3. Restart Your Server
Since we changed the environment variables, you must restart the server for it to take effect:

Go to your terminal where npm run dev is running.
Press Ctrl + C to stop it.
Run npm run dev again.
Once you do this, the "Grant Access" form in /admin/settings will work like magic!
